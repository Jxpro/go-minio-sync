# Go-Minio-Sync

Go-Minio-Sync is a simple tool written in Go, designed to sync files to a Minio server efficiently. It supports multi-threaded file transfer and resumable uploads to optimize performance and reliability.

## Features

- **Multi-threaded File Transfer**: Accelerates the file upload process by utilizing multiple threads.
- **Resumable Uploads**: Supports breaking the upload process into parts and resuming interrupted transfers without starting over.
- **Minio Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Minio, a high-performance object storage service.
